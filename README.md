#hello there

We made an interface which processes information about the crew members and gives an analysis on their level of healthiness 
mental and physically, this in order to protect their well-being on mission. Also, we made an assistant that gathers i
nformation of the ship, its system and elements like spacesuits, it makes statistics on how sustainable is the base gonna be 
for a period of time, details on the mechanical parts of the base and calculations of management of the resources given on a 
mission for it to be completed with success. Our objective is to prevent all kind of issues in a practical way which gives 
safety for the crew and prevents the spread of COVID-19 for ground control.

To manage to work this, first download all the archives, then execute the runner.java  class so that you can experience what we
manage to made.

Best regards
